# Second-Assignment-DataScience


This is the second homework of the Foundations of Data Science exam. The homework was to develop some basic statistical learning algorithm, like Logistic Regression using different optimization algorithms. In the end we can also see a basic comparison between different methods such as Polynomial Regression and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA).
