# Second Assignment DataScience

This is the second homework of the Foundations of Data Science course. The task was to develop some basic statistical learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, using different optimization algorithms. At the end we can also see a basic comparison between different methods such as Poynomial Regression and Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA).

All the code is inside the jupyter notebook.
